# AoC-2019
After a while searching I found these AoC 2019 solutions, although only Days 1, 2, and 5 for some reason. Oh and also some version of the Intcode computer, I can't tell how far I had implemented it (days-wise). Yes, these "solutions" are fucking awful. I'm not even sure if I can even understand the code. I wrote these in year 13 during break and lunchtimes at school, probably whilst being watched by a friend who was also doing Advent of Code but is a genius and wrote his own Fluid Dynamics Simulator in year 12 (yes, he went to Cambridge to study Engineering). And I do not code well whilst being watched. That's my excuse anyway, most people reading this knows that it's actually because up until the end of year 13 I was crap at coding.

Despite only having 4 programs, I did actually complete a few different days. I have no idea where those programs have gone though. Probably deleted them in a fit of rage (or three).

Thanks to Github Copilot for helping me write this README. It could have been so much worse though:
